# Healthcare-Data-Analysis

## Description
This project follows a structured workflow for exploring, cleaning, transforming, and analyzing a healthcare dataset using **Python**, **SQL**, **Power BI**, and **LaTeX**. The work is organized into phases to provide a clear roadmap from raw data to a professional final report.

## Technologies Used
- Python  
- SQL  
- Power BI  
- LaTeX  

## Python Libraries Used
- numpy  
- seaborn  
- scipy  
- scikit-learn  
- matplotlib  
- pandas  

## Machine Learning Models/Techniques Used
- LabelEncoder  
- StandardScaler  
- K-Means Clustering

## Project Phases

### Phase 1: Data Preparation and Schema Design
- Clean, preprocess, and validate the dataset using Python  
- Perform transformations and preliminary exploratory analysis  
- Build an entity-relationship diagram in ERDPlus  
- Finalize the relational schema for database integration  

### Phase 2: Advanced Python Analysis
- Conduct higher-level data analysis including statistical testing  
- Implement machine learning techniques such as K-means clustering for patient segmentation or pattern discovery  

### Phase 3: SQL Query Analysis
- Implement the database schema  
- Develop SQL queries to extract insights, perform joins, and generate aggregates  
- Document findings based on query outputs  

### Phase 4: Dashboard Development (Power BI)
- Connect SQL results or the cleaned dataset to Power BI  
- Create interactive dashboards to visualize KPIs, trends, and comparisons  

### Phase 5: Report Preparation (LaTeX)
- Compile methodologies, SQL analyses, Python advanced analytics, and Power BI results  
- Write a professional academic-style report supported by figures and tables
